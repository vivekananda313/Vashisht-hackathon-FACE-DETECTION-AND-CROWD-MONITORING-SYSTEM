## Problem statement 
Developing an Efficient Face Detection and Crowd Monitoring System for Public Safety and Security
## About the project
Real-time Face Detection: Develop algorithms capable of accurately detecting and recognizing human faces in live video feeds, considering factors such as variations in lighting, occlusions, and facial orientations.
Crowd Density Estimation: Implement techniques to estimate crowd density and analyze crowd movements using video streams from surveillance cameras, enabling real-time monitoring of crowd behavior.

## Technical implemntaion 
 Utilize deep learning-based approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate face detection.
 Train the model on large datasets with diverse face images to improve robustness.
Employ techniques such as Haar cascades, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) for real-time performance.
